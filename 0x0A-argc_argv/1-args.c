C - argc, argv

                


                

TASKS

                


                

[0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to](0-whatsmyname.c)

                


                

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

                


                

If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again

                

You should not remove the path before the name of the program

                


                

[1. Silence is argument carried out by other means](1-args.c)

                


                

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

                


                

Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

                


                


                

[2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter](2-args.c)

                


                

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

                


                

All arguments should be printed, including the first one

                

Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

                


                

[3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument](3-mul.c)

                


                

Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

                


                

Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line

                

You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer

                

If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

                


                

[4. To infinity and beyond](4-add.c)

                


                

Write a program that adds positive numbers.

                


                

Print the result, followed by a new line

                

If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line

                

If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

                

You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int

                


                

[5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change](100-change.c)

                


                

Write a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

                


                

Usage: ./change cents

                

where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back

                

if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

                

you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program

                

If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line

                

You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent
